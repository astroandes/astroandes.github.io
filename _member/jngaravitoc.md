**Bio:**

I'm an astronomy Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona/Steward Observatory.
I earned my Masters degree in physics from Universidad de Los Andes,  Bogot√°.
There, I worked with professor Jaime E. Forero-Romero on radiative transfer models
of Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies.  Previous to that, I earned my B.S in physics
at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Currently,  My research is in the area of
computational galaxy dynamics. In particular, I am interested in implementing
new techniques to quantify the dark matter distribution of the Milky Way Galaxy.
