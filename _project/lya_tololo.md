**Abstract:**

Star-forming Compact Dwarf Galaxies (CDGs) resemble the expected pristine
conditions of the first galaxies in the Universe and are the best systems to
test models on primordial galaxy formation and evolution. Here we report on one
of such CDGs, Tololo 1214-277, which presents a broad, single peaked, highly
symmetric Lyman Alpha emission line that had evaded theoretical interpretation
so far. In this paper we reproduce for the first time these line features with
two different physically motivated kinematic models: an interstellar medium
composed by outflowing clumps with random motions and an homogeneous gaseous
sphere undergoing solid body rotation. The multiphase model requires a clump
velocity dispersion of 54.3 ± 0.6 km/s with outflows of 54.3 ± 5.1 km/s, while the
bulk rotation velocity is constrained to be 348 +75 -48 km/s. We argue that the
results from the multiphase model provide a correct interpretation of the data.
In that case the clump velocity dispersion implies a dynamical mass of
2x10E9 solar masses, ten times its baryonic mass. If future kinematic
maps of Tololo 1214-277 confirm the velocities suggested by the multiphase model,
it would provide additional support to expect such kinematic state in primordial
galaxies, opening the opportunity to use the models and methods presented in this
paper to constrain the physics of star formation and feedback in the early
generation of Lyman Alpha emitting galaxies.
