**Abstract:**

Outflows and rotation are two ubiquitous kinematic features in the gas
distributions of galaxies. Here we perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations of outflowing gas with additional solid body rotation to understand
how these two features impact the morphology of the Lyman-Alpha emission line.
One of the most notorious results is that rotation increases the detected flux
at the line's center in comparison with the non-rotational case. Rotation also
induces a line broadening and a dependency with the viewing angle. We present a
semi-analytic model that modifies the spectra of non-rotational that manages to
reproduce the main features of these Monte Carlo simulations. As an application
example we contraint the rotation parameters to the observed Lyman-Alpha profile
of a high redshift LAE, providing the first a constraint on the rotational
velocity of a high redshift galaxy based on its integrated Lyman-Alpha emission.
