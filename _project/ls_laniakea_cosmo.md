**Abstract:**

Galaxy superclusters can be defined as regions of converging galaxy velocity flows. Such structures have quantifiable properties such as mass, volume and shape. The most precise quantification of such an object has been done on our local supercluster, Laniakea. In this work the properties of Laniakea are compared to the expectations from a ΛCDM Universe. Cosmological N-body simulations are used in order to find cosmic flow fields of dark matter halos and find superclusters using a watershed algorithm. In addition, the distributions of volume of the superclusters found in those simulations are quantified and compared with known values for Laniakea. The latter process was done for both Planck 2015 cosmologies and cosmologies with extreme values of Ωm and σ8 parameters. In all those cases Laniakea is found on the right side of the distribution, placing it as an atypical object in a cosmological context.
