**Abstract:**

We use numerical simulations to build an explicit probability distribution for
the asphericity in the satellite distribution around galaxies similar to the
Local Group (LG) in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) paradigm. This allows us
to estimate the atipicallity of the satellite distributions in the LG even when
the underlying simulations do not have enough systems that fully resemble the LG.
We demonstrate the method using three different simulations: Illustris-1,
Illustris-1-Dark and ELVIS. Detailed results differ among the simulations
suggesting a strong influence of the typical Dark Matter (DM) halo mass in the
LG samples. However, there are three common trends. First, at most of 2% the
pairs are expected to have satellite distributions with the same asphericity as
the LG; second, between 27% to 56% of the pairs have a halo with a satellite
distribution as aspherical as in M31; and third, at most 3% of the pairs have a
satellite distribution as planar as in the MW. The brightest satellites in the
M31 galaxy have a rather typical distribution in the LCDM context, while the MW
distribution is atypical in this respect. These quantitative results place the
LG at the level of a 3sigma outlier in the LCDM paradigm. We suggest that
understanding the reasons for this atipicality will require quantifying the
asphericity probability distribution as a function of halo mass and large scale
environment. The approach presented here can facilitate that kind study and other
comparisons between different numerical setups and choices to study satellites
around LG pairs in simulations.
