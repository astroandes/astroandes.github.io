**Abstract:**

We explore complexity as a measure of structure for the cosmic web. We found a suitable definition by using the Î²-skeleton graph and the number probability P(n) of a node having n connections. The complexity is computed (up to a normalization constant) as the product between the Shannon entropy S(P) and the Jensen-Shannon divergence between P and the number probability of a random set of points Pr. We use data from N-body simulations from the Abacus Project to study the influence on complexity of six factors: cosmic variance, geometry, Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), redshift evolution, cosmological parameters and number density.
