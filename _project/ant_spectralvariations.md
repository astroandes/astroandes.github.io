**Abstract:**

For more than a century scientists have known about the variations in the radial
velocity of Antares. However, an explanation for this anomaly has not been found
yet, though some theories have given some clues. Additional to this problem, most
of the spectral monitorings of Antares had been carried out in the northern
hemisphere, where Antares could not always be seen. Motivated for the previous
reasons, the Astronomical Observatory of Uniandes started in 2015 a spectral
monitoring of this star, which has taken more than 300 spectra until today.
Therefore, the aim of the project, which is my bachelor thesis, is not only to
measure the radial velocity of the spectra, but also to construct the granulation
diagrams associated with each spectrum, in order to understand the behavior of
the Antares atmosphere. First radial velocities have been calculated and they
give information about unexpected fast oscillations, in which the velocity of
the star changes rapidly in a period of few hours. Explanations for this
phenomenon and other results are going to be obtained soon this semester.
