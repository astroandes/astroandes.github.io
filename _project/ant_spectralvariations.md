For more than a century scientists have known about the variations in the radial velocity of Antares. However, an explanation for this anomaly has not been found yet, though some theories have given some clues. Additional to this problem, most of the spectral monitorings of Antares had been carried out in the northern hemisphere, where Antares could not always be seen. Motivated for the previous reasons, the Astronomical Observatory of Uniandes started in 2015 a spectral monitoring of this star, which has taken more than 300 spectra until today. Therefore, the aim of the project, which is my bachelor thesis, is not only to measure the radial velocity of the spectra, but also to construct the granulation diagrams associated with each spectrum, in order to understand the behavior of the Antares atmosphere.
First radial velocities have been calculated and they give information about unexpected fast oscillations, in which the velocity of the star changes rapidly in a period of few hours. Explanations for this phenomenon and other results are going to be obtained soon this semester.
