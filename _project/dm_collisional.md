**Abstract:**

A numerical simulation of the phase space of a colisional dark matter fluid. Here, we solve the Boltzmann equation in a integer lattice phase space. We simulate the phase space of different structures like the Coma Cluster, the Bullet Cluster, or the Milky Way.The collisional term is modelled using the thermally averaged scattering cross section and an equilibrium distribution. Because of the unknown nature of the dark matter particle, we make use of the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution as an equilibrium distribution.
