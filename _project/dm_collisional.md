**Abstract:**

A numerical simulation of the phase space of a colisional dark matter fluid. Here,
we solve the Boltzmann equation in a integer lattice phase space. We simulate the
phase space of different structures like the Coma Cluster, the Bullet Cluster, or 
the Milky Way. The collisional term is modelled using the thermally averaged
scattering cross section and an equilibrium distribution. Because of the unknown
nature of the dark matter particle, we make use of the Fermi-Dirac distribution
and the Bose-Einstein distribution as an equilibrium distribution.
